# AI Summarization

## Hugging Face Example App

Hugging Face is a great platform for building AI applications, and you can create a simple **free** AI model that summarizes articles using their pre-trained models and the `transformers` library. Here‚Äôs how you can get started:

---

### üöÄ **Step 1: Set Up Your Environment**

You'll need Python installed on your system. If you don‚Äôt have it yet, download and install Python (preferably 3.8+).

Then, install the Hugging Face `transformers` and `datasets` libraries:

```bash
pip install transformers datasets torch
```

---

### üß† **Step 2: Load a Pre-trained Summarization Model**

Hugging Face provides powerful models like **"facebook/bart-large-cnn"** for text summarization.

Here‚Äôs how you can load and use it in Python:

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load the summarization pipeline
summarizer = pipeline("summarization", model="facebook/bart-large-cnn")

# Example article
article = """
The recent advancements in artificial intelligence have led to significant breakthroughs in natural language processing.
Companies like OpenAI and Google are pushing the boundaries of what AI can achieve, from chatbots to creative writing.
Despite these advancements, ethical concerns remain regarding AI's impact on jobs and misinformation.
Experts suggest that regulations should be put in place to ensure responsible AI development.
"""

# Generate the summary
summary = summarizer(article, max_length=50, min_length=20, do_sample=False)

# Print the result
print("Summary:", summary[0]['summary_text'])
```

---

### üñ•Ô∏è **Step 3: Deploy It Online for Free (Optional)**

You can deploy this as a web app using **Gradio** (a free UI tool) and share it online:

Install Gradio:

```bash
pip install gradio
```

Create a simple app:

```python
import gradio as gr

def summarize_text(text):
    summary = summarizer(text, max_length=50, min_length=20, do_sample=False)
    return summary[0]['summary_text']

iface = gr.Interface(fn=summarize_text, inputs="text", outputs="text")
iface.launch()
```

Run the script, and it will give you a **public URL** where you and others can test your summarization AI.

### üéØ **Next Steps**

- If you want to fine-tune your own summarization model, you can use Hugging Face‚Äôs **AutoTrain** (<https://huggingface.co/autotrain>).
- You can host this model on **Hugging Face Spaces** for free.
- If you want an API without running it locally, use **Hugging Face Inference API** (limited free tier).
